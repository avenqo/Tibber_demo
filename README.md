# Tibber Demo - Power Consumption
Just a short demo how to fetch power data from tibber

First, you have to provide your Tibber api token via environment variable, i.e.
`export TIBBER_API_TOKEN=tYLQlCswrhP1Alq4pPRC623SkvpNtjr3F1Yq9dfJVYc`
See https://developer.tibber.com/settings/access-token

Second, you must install the necessary modules (check import sections). I was using Python 3.9.5.

Third, you may run the script `python3 main.py`

Have fun.
